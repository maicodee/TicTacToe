Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players mark "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. This GitHub repository has an implementation of the game with a graphical interface to play against another person. 

The game logic is implemented with rules that determine the outcome. It's a great beginner project for those interested in programming and game development.
